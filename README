See COMPILING for build instructions. See CONTRIBUTING for guidelines and an
introduction to modifying the framework. See COPYING for licencing. The
teslib/ subfolder contains the source for the test library programs link to.
The doc/ subfolder contains documentation on the library API and the schema
file format.

§1. Introduction
-----------------

The creation of TES began with Arqadium’s software developments in C, as the
need arose for a simple and reliable testing apparatus with programming for
video games and the worldwide web. We began by examining Google’s C++ testing
framework, GTest, on an executive level, so that we could imitate what they
did and make a testing framework uniquely suited to the needs of Arqadium.
We decided to disclude supporting C++, as we prefer ANSI C instead. In the
place of C++’s metaprogramming we devised a schema format to describe details
about tests that are best not written in C (macro hell). TES will support the
two development environments that Arqadium uses: GNU/Linux and macOS.

§2. Structure of a Test Suite
------------------------------

Here is a repository dirtree.

repo¶
	src/
		aux.c
		aux.h
		main.c
	test/
		aux.c
		datas.fix.h
		main.c
	Makefile
	README

The program’s source code is contained in src/, while the tests for each C
file (treated as one CU, by convention) correspond in the test/ folder. The
Makefile contains all of the usual targets for building the program, plus an
additional .PHONY target, ‘test’, which should invoke the testool command with
some flags.
