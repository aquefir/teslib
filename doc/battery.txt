TEST BATTERY
=============

API for writing the test battery of a program.

§1. #TES_{ASSERT,EXPECT}_*
---------------------------

This collection of macros comprises the bulk of the test battery API. All of
the variants of binary comparison exist, along with ANSI C boolean versions,
and string content equality macros too. Upon failure, ASSERT macros will abort
the program; EXPECT macros will note the failure and continue testing. Thus,
it is best to use EXPECT unless there would be insufficient valid state to
continue upon its failure.

§2. TES_{PRE,POST}
-------------------

These functions are declared as extern in teslib’s main.c. You must implement
them in your test program, although their bodies may be empty.

§3. TES_TESTS
--------------

This function is declared as extern in teslib’s main.c. Your test battery
should be written inside this function, as it will be called from the library.
Be sure to #include <tes/battery.h> as well.
